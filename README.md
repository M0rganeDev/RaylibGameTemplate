_DISCLAIMER:_

Welcome to **raylib game template**!

This template provides a base structure to start developing a small raylib game in C and C++. The repo is also pre-configured with a default `LICENSE` (zlib/libpng) and a `README.md` (this one) to be properly filled by users. Feel free to change the LICENSE as required.

All the sections defined by `MorganeDev` are expected to be edited and filled properly. It's recommended to delete this disclaimer message after editing this `README.md` file. (note : no I wont)

This template has been created to be used with raylib (www.raylib.com) and it's licensed under an unmodified zlib/libpng license.

### Build

Currently, I only support Linux for building. If you use Nix, use the provided flake.nix and run `make run` to start the template project

Windows building will be available one day, maybe. I'm not even sure if it works on Windows

### License

This game sources are licensed under an unmodified zlib/libpng license, which is an OSI-certified, BSD-like license that allows static linking with closed source software. Check [LICENSE](LICENSE) for further details.

All assets made for this project are free for any use of any kind, so long as you dont claim you made them (although I wont care)
